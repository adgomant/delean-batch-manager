Comprehension
This rubric evaluates the difficulty of a task's comprehension requirements, encompassing the understanding of text, stories or the semantic content of other representations of ideas in different formats or modalities. It may include the interpretation of explicit and implicit meanings, recognition of relationships between concepts, processing of contextual information, and understanding of abstract ideas and complex systems. Noteworthy, the mere presence of specialized terminology or jargon does not necessarily indicate a high difficulty level in this rubric, as these terms may appear within tasks that follow simple, straightforward linguistic structures and are more reflective of domain knowledge rather than comprehension complexity. Further, for specialized formal languages (e.g., molecular structures, programming code) the task will be hard to comprehend only if the sequence in that formal language (e.g. molecular expression, snippet of code) is convoluted, but simple molecules or pieces of code should be easy. The rubric include difficult levels that range from tasks requiring no semantic comprehension to those demanding an understanding of highly convoluted, interconnected concepts, including the ability to process sophisticated theoretical frameworks, understand nuanced implications, and synthesize multiple complex perspectives across different domains and levels of abstraction.

Level 0: None. Tasks at this level require no comprehension of language or semantic content, such as those that can be completed by non-human animals. Examples:
* Pulling levers in a specific sequence (pull middle lever, then right lever, then left lever) to release food from a container, learning the pattern through trial and error.
* Manipulating a twist-lid container with multiple appendages in a rotating motion until the lid separates from the base, then retrieving the contents inside.
* Using a stick to push a banana that's out of reach through a fence gap, by positioning and moving the stick in the correct direction.

Level 1: Very Low. Tasks at this level require understanding of basic, explicit meanings in simple formats, including recognition of common words, straightforward statements, and clear one-to-one relationships between symbols and their meanings. Comprehension is limited to surface-level, literal interpretations without need for context or inference. Examples:
* Identifying basic subject-verb relationships that describe observable actions (e.g., "Context: The blue bird was flying high in the sky. Question: who was flying?").
* Understanding simple questions that do not require sophisticated language skills such as "Why is the sky blue?‚Äù
* Understanding single-step instructions where the action directly matches the command (e.g., comprehending the sentence "close the door for me" and mentally connecting these words and the corresponding physical action).

Level 2: Low. Tasks at this level involve comprehending straightforward messages with basic context, including simple cause-effect relationships, clear sequential instructions, and explicit connections between ideas. Understanding requires basic inference but remains tied to concrete, clearly stated information. Examples:
* Capable of answering "why" questions about a simple story (e.g., "Why did the girl take an umbrella?" after reading "Sarah saw dark clouds in the sky. She grabbed her umbrella before leaving home.")
* Understanding simple explanations of processes (e.g., "Plants need water and sunlight to grow, otherwise they will not survive, especially in harsh climate.")
* In a recipe interface, interpreting "Add milk slowly while stirring continuously until mixture thickens" by understanding that the stirring must occur simultaneously with the milk addition, not after.

Level 3: Intermediate. Tasks at this level require understanding of moderately complex information including implicit meanings, metaphorical language, and relationships between multiple concepts. Comprehension may involve processing both explicit and implicit information. Examples:
* In a high school student's history essay about the Industrial Revolution, following their argument that "While factories created more jobs in cities, this urbanization ironically decreased quality of life because cramped living conditions and poor sanitation led to disease outbreaks." This requires understanding how the student is connecting multiple historical factors (industrialization, urbanization, living conditions, public health) and recognizing their use of "ironically" to highlight the unexpected negative consequence of economic progress.
* In an employee handbook, understanding that the statement "The company values work-life balance" combined with "Employees are expected to be responsive to urgent matters outside office hours" represents a potential policy contradiction requiring contextual judgment.
* In a technical manual, interpreting a troubleshooting section that requires understanding how different error messages might indicate the same underlying problem depending on the system's state.

Level 4: High. Tasks at this level demand comprehension of sophisticated content with multiple layers of meaning, complex relationships between concepts, and nuanced implications. Understanding requires integration of various information sources and recognition of subtle patterns and connections. Examples:
* Following an accessible fiction story told from multiple viewpoints where each narrator provides partial, biased information, requiring the reader to construct the true sequence of events by reconciling conflicting accounts and recognizing each narrator's limitations and motivations.
* Understanding a complex academic argument that develops through multiple chapters, where key terms are gradually redefined and earlier arguments are recontextualized by later developments.
* Interpreting a modern theatrical play where dialogue has multiple meanings based on staging directions, character backgrounds, and historical context, requiring simultaneous understanding of textual and performative elements.

Level 5: Very High. Tasks at this level require mastery in understanding highly convoluted, abstract, and interconnected information systems, including sophisticated theoretical frameworks, convoluted narratives and nuanced philosophical arguments. Comprehension involves synthesizing multiple complex perspectives and understanding subtle distinctions. Examples:
* Understanding well a convoluted legal document that requires tracking multiple cross-references, understanding nested conditions, and comprehending how different clauses modify each other.
* Comprehending a modernist novel that uses a stream-of-consciousness narrative technique where multiple timelines, memories, and internal thoughts are interwoven without clear demarcation, requiring readers to track subtle linguistic shifts (changes in tense, pronouns, or narrative voice) to understand when the narrative moves between present action, past memories, imagined futures, and other characters' perspectives. 
* Understanding a convoluted visual narrative where multiple story threads are told simultaneously through different visual styles on the same page, requiring understanding of how the visual elements interact, conflict, and complement each other to create meaning. For example, a graphic novel page where realistic drawings depict current events, sketchy portions represent memories, and geometric patterns show emotional states, all interacting to tell a coherent story.
