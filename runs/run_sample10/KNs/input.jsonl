This does not include natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, earth sciences, ecology) and formal sciences (e.g., mathematics, logic, computer science, statistics). It's important to note that this rubric focuses exclusively on the  domain-specific knowledge needed, not considering other cognitive demands such as reasoning or metacognition. This reflects purely the depth of social sciences and humanities knowledge required.\n\nLevel 0. None: Tasks do not require any knowledge or understanding of social sciences or humanities. Examples:\n* \u201cCalculating the area of a rectangle with length 5 cm and width 3 cm.\u201d\n* \u201cExplaining the process of photosynthesis in plants.\u201d\n* \u201cExplaining the mathematical principles behind differential calculus.\u201d\n\nLevel 1. Very low: Tasks that require knowledge in social sciences and humanities typically acquired through elementary school education. Examples:\n* Basic concepts of past, present, and future in history.\n* Different types of communities (family, school, neighborhood).\n* Traditional holidays and their basic meanings.\n\nLevel 2. Low: Tasks that require knowledge in social sciences and humanities typically acquired through middle school education. Examples:\n* Basic historical periods like \"ancient\" vs \"modern\" times.\n* Different types of government (democracy, monarchy).\n* Major world religions and their basic beliefs.\n\nLevel 3. Intermediate: Tasks that require knowledge in social sciences and humanities typically acquired through high school education. Examples:\n* The role of the Silk Road in cultural exchange.\n* Basic principles of cognitive psychology.\n* Major literary movements (Romanticism, Realism).\n\nLevel 4. High: Tasks that require knowledge in social sciences and humanities typically acquired through undergraduate education. Examples:\n* The socio-economic factors that led to the Industrial Revolution.\n* Major sociological theories of social stratification.\n* The main theoretical approaches in anthropology.\n\nLevel 5. Very high: Tasks that require knowledge in social sciences and humanities typically acquired through graduate education or beyond. Examples:\n* The major schools of Sanskrit poetics.\n* The primary theoretical frameworks in phenomenology.\n* Advanced theories in historical linguistics and their implications.\n\nTASK INSTANCE: Identify the city that is less than 31 km away from Ajax and has the most inhabitants.\n\nINSTRUCTION: Score the level of *Knowledge in Social Sciences and Humanities* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE using a discrete value from 0 to 5. Use CHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING to reason step by step before assigning the score.
