Examples:\n* \u201cWrite a python script to train a machine learning classifier for fake news detection.\u201d\n* \u201cAnalyze the symbolism in Shakespeare's Hamlet\u201d.\n* \u201cCalculate the cost of groceries.\u201d\n\nLevel 1. Very low: Tasks that require knowledge in natural sciences typically acquired through elementary school education. Examples:\n* Living things need food, water, and air to survive.\n* Basic parts of a plant (roots, stem, leaves).\n* Day and night cycle and seasons.\n\nLevel 2. Low: Tasks that require knowledge in natural sciences typically acquired through middle school education. Examples:\n* The water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation).\n* Basic cellular structure (nucleus, membrane, cytoplasm).\n* Simple food chains and ecosystems.\n\nLevel 3. Intermediate: Tasks that require knowledge in natural sciences typically acquired through high school education. Examples:\n* Mendel's laws of inheritance and basic genetics.\n* The ideal gas law (PV = nRT).\n* Newton's three laws of motion.\n\nLevel 4. High: Tasks that require knowledge in natural sciences typically acquired through undergraduate education. Examples:\n* Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and population genetics.\n* Molecular orbital theory.\n* The process of cellular respiration and its relationship to photosynthesis.\n\nLevel 5. Very high: Tasks that require knowledge in natural sciences typically acquired through graduate education or beyond. Examples:\n* The theoretical frameworks of string theory and its implications.\n* The six forms of quark flavors in particle physics.\n* The role of quantum entanglement in biological systems.\n\nTASK INSTANCE: Identify the city that is less than 31 km away from Ajax and has the most inhabitants.\n\nINSTRUCTION: Score the level of *Knowledge in Natural Sciences* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE using a discrete value from 0 to 5. Use CHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING to reason step by step before assigning the score. After the CHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING STEPS, conclude your assessment with the statement: \"Thus, the level of *Knowledge in Natural Sciences* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE is: SCORE\", where SCORE is an integer score you have determined.\n\nCHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING STEPS to score the level of *Knowledge in Natural Sciences* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE above:"}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0}}
