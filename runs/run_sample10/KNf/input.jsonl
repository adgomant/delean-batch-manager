Examples:\n* Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \u00d7, \u00f7).\n* Names and properties of basic shapes (square, circle, triangle).\n* Understanding that a programming loop with 10 repetitions takes double time than a loop with 5 repetitions.\n\nLevel 2. Low: Tasks that require knowledge in formal sciences typically acquired through middle school education. Examples:\n* Basic algebraic expressions and variables.\n* Calculating mean, median, and mode.\n* Properties of basic number systems (integers, decimals, fractions).\n\nLevel 3. Intermediate: Tasks that require knowledge in formal sciences typically acquired through high school education. Examples:\n* Basic geometric shapes and their properties.\n* What an algorithm is.\n* Fundamental concepts of logic and syllogisms.\n\nLevel 4. High: Tasks that require knowledge in formal sciences typically acquired through undergraduate education. Examples:\n* The fundamental theorem of calculus.\n* Principles of object-oriented programming.\n* Basic concepts in linear algebra and matrix operations.\n\nLevel 5. Very high: Tasks that require knowledge in formal sciences typically acquired through graduate education or beyond. Examples:\n* Principles of homological algebra.\n* Mathematical foundations of quantum computing.\n* Advanced concepts in cryptography and their mathematical basis.\n\nTASK INSTANCE: Identify the city that is less than 31 km away from Ajax and has the most inhabitants.\n\nINSTRUCTION: Score the level of *Knowledge in Formal Sciences* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE using a discrete value from 0 to 5. Use CHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING to reason step by step before assigning the score. After the CHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING STEPS, conclude your assessment with the statement: \"Thus, the level of *Knowledge in Formal Sciences* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE is: SCORE\", where SCORE is an integer score you have determined.\n\nCHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING STEPS to score the level of *Knowledge in Formal Sciences* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE above:"}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0}}
