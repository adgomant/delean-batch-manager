Examples:\n* \"What is 5205175017521571 + 68270867426872052?\"\n* \u201cAmong the following exoplanets, which one has the lowest density? a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. b) A planet with 3 Earth masses and a density of approximately 4.6 g/cm^3. c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 1.5 times more massive than Earth. d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.\u201d\n* Get answers for the question based on the context, where answers derived from substrings in the context or categorized as [unanswerable].

The task is not extremely uncommon and the specific task instance is infrequent or presented in notably different ways from standard formulations. Examples:\n* \"Create a measurement system where accuracy is expressed through different shapes rather than decimal places.\"\n* \"Assume that there exist only two types of people: knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, while knaves always lie.\\nYou are given the statements from 5 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a knight and who is a knave.\\nA: B is a liar and D is a truth-teller.\\nB: D is a truth-teller.\\nC: If A is a truth-teller, then E is a liar.\\nD: B is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\\nE: A is a liar.\"\n* \u201cIn the context of neurolinguistic processing models examining the interface between phonological working memory and syntactic parsing during real-time sentence comprehension, what is the primary anatomical structure that shows increased metabolic activity during novel word acquisition in fMRI studies?\u201d [This is a very sophisticated way of asking \u201cwhich part of the brain lights up when we learn new words?\u201d]\n\nLevel 5: Very High. The task is fundamentally different from those typically appearing on the Internet, textbooks or psychological or achievement tests, or, the specific task instance is very unlikely to have close analogues in those sources. Noteworthy, any tasks (simple or elaborate) that can be found in standard tests or benchmarks should be considered less than level 5. Examples:\n* \"Take 20 major sky constellations and design 20 Formula1 race circuits that follow the FIA regulations but mimic the shapes of the constellations.\u201d\n* \u201cWrite a poem in fifty African languages, with each line in one language, with the number of letters e in the line being proportional to the speakers of those languages\"\n* \"List mathematical terms that are also dancing terms (like 'step function' or 'rotation'), then write dance instructions using only mathematical language. However, the dance must stem from an Asian country since I'm teaching a creative Asian dance course today to one student who happens to be a mathematician.\"\n\nTASK INSTANCE: Identify the city that is less than 31 km away from Ajax and has the most inhabitants.\n\nINSTRUCTION: Score the level of *Atypicality* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE using a discrete value from 0 to 5. Use CHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING to reason step by step before assigning the score. After the CHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING STEPS, conclude your assessment with the statement: \"Thus, the level of *Atypicality* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE is: SCORE\", where SCORE is an integer score you have determined.\n\nCHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING STEPS to score the level of *Atypicality* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE above:"}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0}}
