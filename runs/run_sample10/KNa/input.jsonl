Noteworthy, this rubric only focuses on applied knowledge and practical implementations rather than purely theoretical frameworks or abstract concepts from natural sciences, formal sciences, social sciences and humanities. For instance, understanding chemical reactions is only part of natural sciences, but applying this knowledge in pharmaceutical manufacturing would fall under applied sciences. Similarly, economic theory belongs only to social sciences, but practical business management and operations fall under applied sciences and professions.
