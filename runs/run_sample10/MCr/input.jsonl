A fair amount of potentially relevant information is provided, mixed with some irrelevant details. As the respondent works through the problem, they need to evaluate which pieces of information are useful for the next step in their solution process, requiring ongoing but straightforward metacognitive assessment.

The respondent must engage in moderate metacognitive processing throughout the problem-solving process in one or both of these ways: (1) evaluating and reconciling potentially conflicting or redundant information that serves as distractors within a manageable search space, or (2) recognizing what additional information or problem-solving approaches are needed when not all relevant information is explicitly provided, but the possible solution paths remain relatively constrained. Some information that seems irrelevant initially may become important later, or some unstated information may become crucial to identify as the solution progresses.
