It may include the usage  of the right vocabulary, adoption of the appropriate genre, formulation of explicit and implicit meanings, creation of relationships between concepts, incorporation of contextual information, expression of abstract ideas and complex systems, and transformation of sophisticated content into a smooth narrative. Noteworthy, the need of specialized vocabulary or jargon in the expression does not necessarily indicate a high level of difficulty, as these terms may be used within simple, straightforward linguistic structures requiring minimal compositional complexity and are more reflective of domain knowledge rather than expression sophistication. In addition, the difficulty level should correspond to the simplest expression effort to successfully solve the task, given that a solution to a task may be formulated in various ways with varied linguistic complexity; multiple-choice questions, even if the options are long and complex, generally do not require language expression beyond the basic level, so they are typically level 1. The rubric ranges from tasks requiring no meaningful expression to those demanding the generation of highly sophisticated, interconnected content, including the ability to create convoluted narratives, convey nuanced implications, and express multiple perspectives across different domains and levels of abstraction.\n\nLevel 0: None. Tasks at this level involve no meaningful expression or communication, limited to automatic responses or simple pattern reproduction. The task can be completed through purely mechanical or algorithmic processes without any generation of meaning. Examples:\n* Repeating a sound pattern exactly as heard without understanding or modifying its meaning.\n* Copying text from one format to another without generating or modifying content.\n* Reproducing a sequence of gestures through simple mimicry.\n\nLevel 1: Very Low. Tasks at this level require expressing basic, explicit meanings in simple formats, including use of common words, straightforward statements, and clear one-to-one relationships between ideas and their expression. Expression is limited to surface-level, literal articulation without need for context or nuance. Examples:\n* Stating immediate needs like \"I need water\" in a simple, direct, unambiguous way.\n* Solving a task that requires domain expertise to get the right answer but the answer only requires basic expression ability (e.g. \u201cGiven the product SMILES: O=C(NC1CCN(CCc2ccccc2)CC1)c1c[nH]c2ccc(F)cc12, predict the reactants SMILES\u201d.\n* Multiple-choice QA questions, where the subject only needs to choose one readily available option, even though the accurate answer option may be formulated in a linguistically complex manner (e.g. \"The correct answer is option C. Reynolds and Khripkova would not make suitable business partners, [...], if they quarrel, know how to resolve their differences.\")\n\nLevel 2: Low. Tasks at this level involve producing straightforward messages with basic context, such as simple cause-effect relationships, clear sequential instructions, and explicit connections between ideas. Expression requires basic organization but remains tied to concrete, clearly stated information. Examples:\n* \u201cWriting step-by-step instructions for making a sandwich, clearly indicating the sequence of actions and basic quantities needed.\u201d\n* Creating a brief email to schedule a meeting, specifying time, place, and basic purpose.\n* Describing a simple process like plant growth, connecting the basic sequence of events: \"First the seed needs soil and water, then it grows roots, then it sprouts leaves.\"\n\nLevel 3: Intermediate. Tasks at this level require generating moderately nuanced information, with attention to both content and presentation style. This includes selecting field-appropriate vocabulary, adapting to specific genres (like technical documentation or clinical notes), and creating coherent narratives that smoothly connect ideas. Expression may involve conveying both explicit and implicit information while maintaining consistent tone and voice throughout the text. Examples:\n* Writing explanatory notes for a simple geometry proof that guides the reader through the logic: \"To prove these triangles are similar, we first show their angles are equal. The alternate angles formed by these parallel lines are equal, and since both triangles share this angle at point A, we can conclude...\"\n* Writing product documentation that anticipates user confusion: \"While the red indicator light typically signals an error, in sleep mode it indicates normal operation. If the light flashes red during active use, consult the troubleshooting guide.\"\n* Writing short clinical notes that connect symptoms with potential causes: \"Patient presents with persistent cough and fatigue for 2 weeks. Given their recent travel history and exposure to dusty environments, considering both viral upper respiratory infection and environmental allergies as potential causes.\"\n\nLevel 4: High. Tasks at this level demand generating sophisticated content with multiple layers of meaning, complex relationships between concepts, and nuanced implications. Such expressions may include the usage of linguistically advanced vocabulary and rhetorical devices, careful attention to genre conventions, and the ability to integrate multiple perspectives and communicate subtle patterns and connections. Examples:\n* Writing lecture notes that integrate multivariable calculus with linear algebra to explain the connection between Jacobian matrices, coordinate transformations, and volume changes in higher dimensions.\n* Writing technical documentation that addresses multiple user levels simultaneously: \"The API's modular design allows for both simple plug-and-play implementation for basic use cases and sophisticated customization through advanced configuration options, ensuring scalability as your needs evolve.\"\n* Writing a detailed legal brief that weaves together statutory requirements, case law precedents, and policy implications: \"While Smith v. Jones (2019) established a broad interpretation of 'reasonable care,' the specific circumstances of our case, combined with the legislative history of Section 47(b), suggest that this standard should be qualified when applied to specialized industrial settings...\"\n\nLevel 5: Very High. Tasks at this level require mastery in generating convoluted, abstract, and interconnected content, including nuanced vocabulary, convoluted narratives, deep arguments, and conveying multiple perspectives and subtle distinctions simultaneously. Examples:\n* Writing a few paragraphs of a graduate-level textbook section that develops the relationship between Lie groups, Lie algebras, and differential manifolds.\n* Creating a convoluted multi-layered narrative that simultaneously develops several plot threads through carefully structured revelations, such as a novel seemingly disconnected opening chapters gradually revealing their interconnections through subtle linguistic echoes and thematic resonances, allowing readers to piece together the full story while maintaining tension across multiple timelines.\n* Writing well-thought comprehensive hospital policy guidelines that address complex medical, legal, and ethical considerations: \"The protocol for experimental treatments must balance patient autonomy, clinical evidence requirements, and legal liability considerations.

It may include the usage  of the right vocabulary, adoption of the appropriate genre, formulation of explicit and implicit meanings, creation of relationships between concepts, incorporation of contextual information, expression of abstract ideas and complex systems, and transformation of sophisticated content into a smooth narrative. Noteworthy, the need of specialized vocabulary or jargon in the expression does not necessarily indicate a high level of difficulty, as these terms may be used within simple, straightforward linguistic structures requiring minimal compositional complexity and are more reflective of domain knowledge rather than expression sophistication. In addition, the difficulty level should correspond to the simplest expression effort to successfully solve the task, given that a solution to a task may be formulated in various ways with varied linguistic complexity; multiple-choice questions, even if the options are long and complex, generally do not require language expression beyond the basic level, so they are typically level 1. The rubric ranges from tasks requiring no meaningful expression to those demanding the generation of highly sophisticated, interconnected content, including the ability to create convoluted narratives, convey nuanced implications, and express multiple perspectives across different domains and levels of abstraction.\n\nLevel 0: None. Tasks at this level involve no meaningful expression or communication, limited to automatic responses or simple pattern reproduction. The task can be completed through purely mechanical or algorithmic processes without any generation of meaning. Examples:\n* Repeating a sound pattern exactly as heard without understanding or modifying its meaning.\n* Copying text from one format to another without generating or modifying content.\n* Reproducing a sequence of gestures through simple mimicry.\n\nLevel 1: Very Low. Tasks at this level require expressing basic, explicit meanings in simple formats, including use of common words, straightforward statements, and clear one-to-one relationships between ideas and their expression. Expression is limited to surface-level, literal articulation without need for context or nuance. Examples:\n* Stating immediate needs like \"I need water\" in a simple, direct, unambiguous way.\n* Solving a task that requires domain expertise to get the right answer but the answer only requires basic expression ability (e.g. \u201cGiven the product SMILES: O=C(NC1CCN(CCc2ccccc2)CC1)c1c[nH]c2ccc(F)cc12, predict the reactants SMILES\u201d.\n* Multiple-choice QA questions, where the subject only needs to choose one readily available option, even though the accurate answer option may be formulated in a linguistically complex manner (e.g. \"The correct answer is option C. Reynolds and Khripkova would not make suitable business partners, [...], if they quarrel, know how to resolve their differences.\")\n\nLevel 2: Low. Tasks at this level involve producing straightforward messages with basic context, such as simple cause-effect relationships, clear sequential instructions, and explicit connections between ideas. Expression requires basic organization but remains tied to concrete, clearly stated information. Examples:\n* \u201cWriting step-by-step instructions for making a sandwich, clearly indicating the sequence of actions and basic quantities needed.\u201d\n* Creating a brief email to schedule a meeting, specifying time, place, and basic purpose.\n* Describing a simple process like plant growth, connecting the basic sequence of events: \"First the seed needs soil and water, then it grows roots, then it sprouts leaves.\"\n\nLevel 3: Intermediate. Tasks at this level require generating moderately nuanced information, with attention to both content and presentation style. This includes selecting field-appropriate vocabulary, adapting to specific genres (like technical documentation or clinical notes), and creating coherent narratives that smoothly connect ideas. Expression may involve conveying both explicit and implicit information while maintaining consistent tone and voice throughout the text. Examples:\n* Writing explanatory notes for a simple geometry proof that guides the reader through the logic: \"To prove these triangles are similar, we first show their angles are equal.

The rubric ranges from tasks requiring no meaningful expression to those demanding the generation of highly sophisticated, interconnected content, including the ability to create convoluted narratives, convey nuanced implications, and express multiple perspectives across different domains and levels of abstraction.\n\nLevel 0: None. Tasks at this level involve no meaningful expression or communication, limited to automatic responses or simple pattern reproduction. The task can be completed through purely mechanical or algorithmic processes without any generation of meaning. Examples:\n* Repeating a sound pattern exactly as heard without understanding or modifying its meaning.\n* Copying text from one format to another without generating or modifying content.\n* Reproducing a sequence of gestures through simple mimicry.\n\nLevel 1: Very Low. Tasks at this level require expressing basic, explicit meanings in simple formats, including use of common words, straightforward statements, and clear one-to-one relationships between ideas and their expression. Expression is limited to surface-level, literal articulation without need for context or nuance. Examples:\n* Stating immediate needs like \"I need water\" in a simple, direct, unambiguous way.\n* Solving a task that requires domain expertise to get the right answer but the answer only requires basic expression ability (e.g. \u201cGiven the product SMILES: O=C(NC1CCN(CCc2ccccc2)CC1)c1c[nH]c2ccc(F)cc12, predict the reactants SMILES\u201d.\n* Multiple-choice QA questions, where the subject only needs to choose one readily available option, even though the accurate answer option may be formulated in a linguistically complex manner (e.g. \"The correct answer is option C. Reynolds and Khripkova would not make suitable business partners, [...], if they quarrel, know how to resolve their differences.\")\n\nLevel 2: Low. Tasks at this level involve producing straightforward messages with basic context, such as simple cause-effect relationships, clear sequential instructions, and explicit connections between ideas. Expression requires basic organization but remains tied to concrete, clearly stated information. Examples:\n* \u201cWriting step-by-step instructions for making a sandwich, clearly indicating the sequence of actions and basic quantities needed.\u201d\n* Creating a brief email to schedule a meeting, specifying time, place, and basic purpose.\n* Describing a simple process like plant growth, connecting the basic sequence of events: \"First the seed needs soil and water, then it grows roots, then it sprouts leaves.\"\n\nLevel 3: Intermediate. Tasks at this level require generating moderately nuanced information, with attention to both content and presentation style. This includes selecting field-appropriate vocabulary, adapting to specific genres (like technical documentation or clinical notes), and creating coherent narratives that smoothly connect ideas. Expression may involve conveying both explicit and implicit information while maintaining consistent tone and voice throughout the text. Examples:\n* Writing explanatory notes for a simple geometry proof that guides the reader through the logic: \"To prove these triangles are similar, we first show their angles are equal. The alternate angles formed by these parallel lines are equal, and since both triangles share this angle at point A, we can conclude...\"\n* Writing product documentation that anticipates user confusion: \"While the red indicator light typically signals an error, in sleep mode it indicates normal operation. If the light flashes red during active use, consult the troubleshooting guide.\"\n* Writing short clinical notes that connect symptoms with potential causes: \"Patient presents with persistent cough and fatigue for 2 weeks. Given their recent travel history and exposure to dusty environments, considering both viral upper respiratory infection and environmental allergies as potential causes.\"\n\nLevel 4: High. Tasks at this level demand generating sophisticated content with multiple layers of meaning, complex relationships between concepts, and nuanced implications. Such expressions may include the usage of linguistically advanced vocabulary and rhetorical devices, careful attention to genre conventions, and the ability to integrate multiple perspectives and communicate subtle patterns and connections. Examples:\n* Writing lecture notes that integrate multivariable calculus with linear algebra to explain the connection between Jacobian matrices, coordinate transformations, and volume changes in higher dimensions.\n* Writing technical documentation that addresses multiple user levels simultaneously: \"The API's modular design allows for both simple plug-and-play implementation for basic use cases and sophisticated customization through advanced configuration options, ensuring scalability as your needs evolve.\"\n* Writing a detailed legal brief that weaves together statutory requirements, case law precedents, and policy implications: \"While Smith v. Jones (2019) established a broad interpretation of 'reasonable care,' the specific circumstances of our case, combined with the legislative history of Section 47(b), suggest that this standard should be qualified when applied to specialized industrial settings...\"\n\nLevel 5: Very High. Tasks at this level require mastery in generating convoluted, abstract, and interconnected content, including nuanced vocabulary, convoluted narratives, deep arguments, and conveying multiple perspectives and subtle distinctions simultaneously. Examples:\n* Writing a few paragraphs of a graduate-level textbook section that develops the relationship between Lie groups, Lie algebras, and differential manifolds.\n* Creating a convoluted multi-layered narrative that simultaneously develops several plot threads through carefully structured revelations, such as a novel seemingly disconnected opening chapters gradually revealing their interconnections through subtle linguistic echoes and thematic resonances, allowing readers to piece together the full story while maintaining tension across multiple timelines.\n* Writing well-thought comprehensive hospital policy guidelines that address complex medical, legal, and ethical considerations: \"The protocol for experimental treatments must balance patient autonomy, clinical evidence requirements, and legal liability considerations. When standard treatments are exhausted, the following decision tree integrates real-time clinical assessment, informed consent documentation, ethics committee review, and liability mitigation steps, while maintaining compliance with both state regulations and international medical ethics standards...\"\n\nTASK INSTANCE: Identify the city that is less than 31 km away from Ajax and has the most inhabitants.\n\nINSTRUCTION: Score the level of *Expression* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE using a discrete value from 0 to 5.
