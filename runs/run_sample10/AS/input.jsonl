The target information is in an environment mixed with numerous distractors and changing conditions. requires some continuous monitoring amid competing signals.\nExamples: \n* \"Listening to a symphony, identify all instances where the clarinet plays in a minor key, even when it's not playing the main melody.\n* \"Track three orange spheres among twenty red spheres as they move randomly across a black screen (40 cm \u00d7 30 cm) at varying speeds (1-3 cm/s), with spheres frequently intersecting paths and maintaining a minimum separation distance of 2 cm. Each sphere is 1 cm in diameter.\"\n* \"In a real-time video feed of a busy airport, finding the locations of ten blue suitcases.\"\n\nLevel 5: Very high. Requires sustained attention and scan for simultaneous tracking of multiple targets across different domains or contexts, with continuous adaptation to fast-changing conditions. The target information is extremely difficult to distinguish from distractors or is hidden in a vast or constantly changing environment. \nExamples:\n* \"While seated courtside at a professional basketball game, track two specific players throughout the entire game as they move at speeds up to 8m/s, frequently cluster with other players during rebounds, and weave through screens and defensive formations.\"\n* \"Monitor four simultaneous video feeds of a crowded airport terminal from different angles, detecting subtle security-relevant changes (e.g. brief interactions < 2 seconds, crowd flow changes, small object exchanges) across feeds.\"\n* \"While monitoring multiple simultaneous customer service chat conversations in different languages, identify instances where customers are expressing the same underlying technical issue, even though they're describing it using different metaphors, technical terms, or cultural references specific to their region.\"\n\nTASK INSTANCE: Identify the city that is less than 31 km away from Ajax and has the most inhabitants.\n\nINSTRUCTION: Score the level of *Attention and Search* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE using a discrete value from 0 to 5. Use CHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING to reason step by step before assigning the score. After the CHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING STEPS, conclude your assessment with the statement: \"Thus, the level of *Attention and Search* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE is: SCORE\", where SCORE is an integer score you have determined.\n\nCHAIN-OF-THOUGHTS REASONING STEPS to score the level of *Attention and Search* demanded by the given TASK INSTANCE above:"}], "max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0}}
