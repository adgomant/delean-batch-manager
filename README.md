# DeLeAn Batch Manager

> **This repository is part of the [ADeLe v1.0 Project](https://kinds-of-intelligence-cfi.github.io/ADELE/)**, a battery for AI Evaluation with explanatory and predictive power introduced in the paper:
> **[‚ÄúGeneral Scales unlock AI Evaluation with Explanatory and Predictive Power‚Äù (Zhou et al., 2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06378)**.

This toolkit is part of a collaborative effort initiated by researchers at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](https://www.lcfi.ac.uk) (University of Cambridge) and the [Center for Information Technology Policy](https://citp.princeton.edu) (Princeton University), aimed at supporting and extending ADeLe v1.0 ‚Äî a demand-level-based evaluation battery for language models with both explanatory and predictive power.

ADeLe (Annotated Demand Levels) includes 63 tasks from 20 widely-used benchmarks, all annotated using 18 general-purpose rubrics defined in the Demand Level Annotation framework (DeLeAn v1.0). This enables, for the first time, the construction of detailed ability profiles of large language models, offering insights not only into what they can and cannot do, but also into when and where they will behave reliably and safely ‚Äî at the instance level.

By making benchmark results more interpretable and extrapolatable, ADeLe opens the door to more trustworthy model deployment. Moreover, the framework is extensible: by applying the DeLeAn rubric set to new benchmarks, researchers can assess what those benchmarks actually measure.

This repository provides the official toolkit for reproducing and extending the DeLeAn pipeline. It includes a high-level Python API and a comprehensive CLI interface for managing large-scale annotation jobs using the OpenAI Batch API, along with utilities for customizing, reusing and potentially expanding demand-level rubrics. Whether you're contributing to ADeLe or building your own evaluation workflows, this package offers the core infrastructure to make demand-level annotations accessible and reproducible.

## üöÄ Getting Started (CLI)

### Step-by-step example workflow:

```bash
cd path/to/my/project/

deleanbm --run-name example_run setup \
    --data-path ./data/prompt_data.jsonl \ 
    --rubrics-path .data/rubrics \
    --base-folder ./batch_runs/example_run \
    --annotations-folder ./data/annotations
    --openai-model gpt-4o
    --max-completion-tokens 1000

deleanbm -r example_run create-input-files
deleanbm -r example_run launch -parallel
deleanbm -r example_run track-and-download-loop --check-interval 300
deleanbm -r example_run parse-output-files --file-type csv --format wide
```

### CLI help

## üêç Python API Usage

### Basic usage example

```python
from delean_batch_manager import DeLeAnBatchManager
from delean_batch_manager.utils.clients import create_openai_client

client = create_openai_client()

manager = DeLeAnBatchManager(
    client=client
    base_folder="./annotations",
    source_data_file="./data/prompts.jsonl"
    rubrics_folder="./rubrics",
    openai_model="gpt-4o",
    max_completion_tokens=1000
)

manager.create_input_files()
manager.launch()
manager.track_and_download_loop(check_interval=300)
manager.parse_output_files(file_type="csv", format="wide")
```

Check the `examples/` or `notebooks/` folders for more detailed examples.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

* `src/`: Source code for the package
* `rubrics/`: Default rubric battery (DeLeAn v1.0)
* `examples/` & `notebooks/`: Practical usage examples and notebooks (to be added)
* `docs/`: Documentation resources (to be added)

## üìñ Creating Custom Rubrics

You can easily define your own rubrics:

* Create a new `.txt` file named after your acronym (e.g., `NEW.txt`).
* The first line is the full rubric name, followed by the content of the rubric.

Example:

```
New Demand Level
This demand level corresponds to...

0: Level description.
Examples:
- Example 1
- Example 2

1: Another level description.
...
```

Place your rubric file in your rubrics directory and it will be automatically available for annotation.
For consistency with the framework, you should define the rubric to describe, at least, from levels 0 to 5 of the new Demand Level and include some examples for each of them.

## üìä Cost Estimation

Estimate the cost before launching your annotation jobs:

```bash
# Get aroximate (99.95%) cost of current setup
deleanbm -r example_run get-pricing

# Get exact cost using other model for the data and rubrics setted-up 
deleanbm -r example_run get-pricing --openai-model o4-mini --estimation exact 

# Get exact cost for many models the data and rubrics setted-up 
deleanbm -r example_run get-pricing -m gpt-4o -m o4-mini -m gpt-3.5-turbo

# Get exact cost using other model and more tokens for the data and rubrics setted-up
deleanbm -r example_run get-pricing --openai-model o4-mini --max-completion-tokens 2000
```
